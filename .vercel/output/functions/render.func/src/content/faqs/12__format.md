question: What format are your tutorials and challenges in?
order: 12
---

Each month, you'll receive 2 emails from me.

1. The first email will be delivered the first week of each month, with a challenge inside. The challenge will be written out and links to all assets you need to get started.
2. The second email will be delivered two weeks later, with a link the solution. This will be a recorded video and include the final code.

When you sign-up, you'll also receive an email from Podia. This is where we're hosting all the content and where you'll have lifetime access. You might need to check your spam. This should come from an email address ending in **@e.podia.com**.
