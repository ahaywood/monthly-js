Dude, business is risky. And while we love using our experiences, and the experiences of countless other entrepreneurs we know, have worked, business is still risky. So our advice doesn’t come with any guarantees. You get that, right? Cool. Oh, and if you need professional help, consider hiring a business consultant. Preferably one with a suit and briefcase.

## ADVICE: CAREER, PARENTING, AND ANYTHING ELSE WE’RE GIVING OUR OPINION ABOUT

Monthly JavaScript is a set of challenges for educational and informational purposes. (And sometimes venting about inappropriate topics such as individuals who wear Vibram Five Fingers to dinner parties. You know–the usual.) While creating our series of challenges, we used our experiences, the experiences of others and various other resources including but not limited to the wild wild web, the Encyclopedia Britannica (what? you didn’t buy the extended library collection of 1989?). That said, my advice doesn’t come with any guarantees. By visiting this site, you’re essentially signing a contract that says that you understand that I make no guarantees, and you won’t try to sue me or report me to the Biden administration. Because that would be awkward.

## AFFILIATE LINKS DISCLAIMER

Guess what? If you click on a link that I’ve provided, it might be a link to someone who will give me a commission if you buy something from their site. That means that I might get paid if you click on that link. And the reason why I’m telling you this is because I want to be upfront with you, and because it’s illegal not to. (So, you know, right side of the law and all.) That said, I promise to use any affiliate commissions earned for good causes: Things like reinvesting in this business to bring you even better resources, and quite possibly at least one Sunday trip to the zoo. Because…zoos.

## PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS

We love our products, and we hope you do, too. That said, sometimes we might slip up, and sometimes, errors happen. Things like pricing or merchandise descriptions get mixed up, and then we look bad. While that stinks, what’s most important to us is that you’re happy. So while we can’t guarantee that all information on the site is always 100% accurate at any given time, if you do notice a mistake? Please don’t hesitate to [contact us](mailto:support@monthlycss.com) and let us know. Since we can’t guarantee the products for your particular circumstances or purposes, we can guarantee that we’ll give you the best customer service we can to remedy the situation.
