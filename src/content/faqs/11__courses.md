Thanks for asking! If you haven’t already, check out [Monthly JS](https://monthlyjs.com) -- it's _FREE_ too!

- [Advent of CSS](https://adventofcss.com) and [Advent of JavaScript](https://adventofjs.com) - if you like this project, then you're going to love Advent. These are 24 challenges delivered to your inbox during the month of December.
- [Everything Svelte](https://everythingsvelte.com) - everything you ever wanted to know (and then some) about SvelteKit.
- [Learn with Redwood](https://learnwithredwood.com) - Go frontend to full stack, building an application on the latest and greatest web technologies: React, TypeScript, Prisma, Storybook, Jest, and GraphQL

We also have some other irons in the fire for 2023. Feel free to visit the landing pages and **_express your interest._ – That helps gauge interest:**

- [100 Days of Code](https://100daysofcode.dev) - if you love coding challenges and a way to practice dev every day, this is 100 days challenges
- [Projects for Developers](https://projectsfordev.com) - everyone says that the easiest way to learn how to code and level up your development skills is to build something. But, what do you build? not to mention design?! This project contains all the design work, project stories and specifications for you to build a full-stack application.
- [Starter Kit Design](https://starterkit.design) - Not sure where to start? This kit will have everything you need to start running design sprints, project discovery, and design projects.
- [App from Scratch](http://appfromscratch.academy) - Build a web application from start to finish -- without all the overwhelm. In the past, I've learned the most when I've gotten real-world experience by looking over someone else's shoulder. In this course, I invite you to look over mine. We'll look at the application's entire life cycle: validating your app idea, discovery, design, project management, frontend, and backend development, testing, and launching. -- All in one place.

Also, find me elsewhere online:

- I co-host a podcast with [James Q Quick](https://jamesqquick.com) called [Compressed.fm](https://compressed.fm) where we talk about web development and design with a little bit of zest.
- I blog at [SelfTeach.me](https://selfteach.me), post videos on [YouTube](https://youtube.com), live stream on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/selfteachme), and post in 280 characters chunks on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/selfteachme)
