Feel free to put your code on GitHub. But, if you’ve paid for the solutions, do not put our code on GitHub.

You can include these challenges within your portfolio, but be honest about your contributions.

I’d love for you to write about how you solved the problem. There’s no better way to learn! Please tweet about it and tag us! **#monthyjs**, especially if you solved the challenge differently than we did.
